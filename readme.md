# PURPOSE

At the current time, Roots for the Home Team (Roots) is not able to efficiently amass the vegetables needed for each event where they sell their salads.  The current process involves much unnecessary back and forth between Roots and their garden program partners. This application aims to improve this process, allowing Roots to communicate more succinctly with these partners, via an automated online portal.
